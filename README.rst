Soylent Recipes
===============

Mines the USDA food database for recipes that satisfy a given daily nutrition
target.

If you already know which foods you want to use for your soylent recipe but
simply want to know the amounts to take of each, you can use this
`online diet problem solver <https://neos-guide.org/content/diet-problem-solver>`_.

In its current state, it may not be very practical, however it proves that a
practical soylent recipe miner can be built.
